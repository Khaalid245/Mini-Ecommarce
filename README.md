## Mini E-commerce App

## Overview

This Mini E-commerce App is a Flutter project built to practice navigation, state management, and various Flutter widgets. The app allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. It utilizes Provider for state management and includes custom UI components such as product cards and a shopping cart.

## Features

- **Navigation:** Uses Flutter's navigation system for seamless transitions between screens.
- **State Management:** Implements Provider to manage shopping cart state.
- **Custom Widgets:** Includes reusable components like MyButton, MyDrawer, and MyProductTile.
- **Shopping Cart Functionality:** Allows users to add and remove products from the cart.
- **Alert Dialogs:** Confirms actions such as removing an item from the cart.
- **Horizontal Scrolling:** Displays products in a horizontally scrollable list.

## Technologies Used
